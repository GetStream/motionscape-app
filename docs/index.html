      <h2>What is MotionScape?</h2>
      <p>
        MotionScape is your animations playground as a developer. You can see
        all animations and their parameters in effect with beautifully designed
        and handcrafted animation examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get help with custom descriptions of all parameters that help you bring
        light into the dark tunnel of confusing namings and concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best of all: directly preview and export your settings as
        production-ready SwiftUI code that you can use in your apps as-is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supercharge your apps with animations and get to know how to use them -
