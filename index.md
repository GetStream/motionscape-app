    <h2>What is MotionScape?</h2>
    <p>
    MotionScape is your animations playground as a developer. You can see
    all animations and their parameters in effect with beautifully designed
    and handcrafted animation examples.
    </p>
    <p>
    Get help with custom descriptions of all parameters that help you bring
    light into the dark tunnel of confusing namings and concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
    Best of all: directly preview and export your settings as
    production-ready SwiftUI code that you can use in your apps as-is.
    </p>
    <p>
    Supercharge your apps with animations and get to know how to use them -
    with MotionScape!
